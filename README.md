# Music Releases
In this weeks project we had to make a music releases site fetching data from Spotify and display it using React.

## The problem

We used React to create components and pass them on to App.js. We started mobile first and followed the design as specified. We learned a lot of React terms and the logic behind it. If we had more time we would apply more features.
